# ChitChat-Chatting-App
ChitChat is a beginner-friendly real-time chat application I built while learning Android development with Kotlin & Jetpack Compose.
It integrates Firebase Authentication, Firestore, and Storage to explore the fundamentals of secure login, instant messaging, and media sharing.

This project represents my eagerness to experiment, learn, and grow as an Android developer.
